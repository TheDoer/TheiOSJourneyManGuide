# Arrays

Swift arrays are ordered lists, meaning that the position of each element is determined by the order it was added. Arrays work off of indexes, which can be used to access and modify the values of individual items.

## Contains
```swift
let hasHitron = self.orderItems.contains { $0.activationModemType == .Hitron }
```
