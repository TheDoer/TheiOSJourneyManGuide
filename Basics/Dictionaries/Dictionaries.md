#Dictionaries

Like arrays, dictionaries are collection types, but instead of holding single values accessed by indexes, they hold key-value pairs. All keys need to be of the same type, and the same goes for values. It's important to know that dictionary items are unordered, and their values are accessed with their associated keys.
